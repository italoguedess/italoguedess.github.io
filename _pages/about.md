I'm Bachelor at Telecommunication engineering at Federal University of Ceará (UFC), started on Brazil in 2022 and my carrear as telecommunication researcher at Wireless Communication Research Group (GTEL). Started at Augost/2021 a scientific initiation supervisioned by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Yuri Carvalho Barbosa Silva, studied Cell-free networks for beyond fifth generations (B5G) communication. Latter, start to work as undergraduate researcher on Ericsson Research supervisioned by Prof. Gábor Fodor (KTH, Sweden), studied the state-of-the-art of Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Since September of 2024, studying in a broad at École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Caen (ENSICAEN) the course of génie physique et système embarqués - major SATE sponsored by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).

Due to good grades on the analogic electronic course, I was invited to volunteer in the first Brazilian Satellite Olympiad (OBSAT) on the Autosat team. After one year of project working on the satellite's firmware, the Autosat Team was classified as the best team in the state and one of the best five teams in Brazil.
