I am a Telecommunications Engineering undergraduate student at the Federal University of Cear√° (UFC), where I began my studies in 2021. From the start of my academic journey, I have been deeply interested in research within my field, joining a Scientific Initiation program in August 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Tarcisio Ferreira Maciel. During this program, I explored topics such as Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks, Base Station Deployment, Quality of Service, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization, culminating in the publication of my first research paper in December 2023.

Building on my academic achievements, I became a member of the Wireless Telecommunications Research Group (GTEL), collaborating with Ericsson Research under the guidance of Dr. Behrooz Makki. At GTEL, I have focused on cutting-edge technologies, including Network-Controlled Repeaters, the subject of my first magazine article, submitted to the IEEE Communications Standards Magazine in January 2024.

Currently, I am participating in an exchange program funded by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) at the National Graduate School of Engineering of Caen (ENSICAEN) in France. Here, I am specializing in Physical Engineering with a major in Embedded Systems and Automation.
