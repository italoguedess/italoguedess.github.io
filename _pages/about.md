I am a Telecommunications Engineering undergraduate student at the Federal University of Cear√° (UFC) since 2021.
Since early, I had great interest in various research topics in my area of study, entering a Scientific Initiation program, already in August/2021, under the supervision of the Prof. Dr.-Ing. Tarcisio Ferreira Maciel, in which I have studied various subjects such as Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks, Base Station Deployment, Quality of Service, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, among others, publishing my first research paper on December 2023.
After a successful studying trajectory, I joined the Wireless Telecommunications Research Group (GTEL), working in partnership with Ericsson Research under the supervision of Dr. Behrooz Makki, studying state-of-the-art technology such as Network Controlled Repeaters, theme of my first magazine work submitted to publication at the IEEE Communications Magazine on January 2024.
Currently I am participating in an exchange program, financed by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), at the National Graduate School of Engineering of Caen (ENSICAEN) in France, studying Physical Engineering and Embedded Systems major in Embedded Systems and Automation.
