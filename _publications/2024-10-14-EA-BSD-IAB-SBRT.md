**Abstract**:
Integrated access and backhaul networks are a good solution for fifth generation networks, due to its potential to increase the bandwidth used for wireless connections and a low implementation cost compared to other solutions. In order to solve the problem of positioning bases, in the proposed work we optimized an Integrated access and backhaul network to increase the spectral efficiency for different proportions of macros and small base stations and, for this, we used genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The results obtained show that for all scenarios it is possible to obtain a high spectral efficiency, however, for scenarios with low proportions of small base stations, genetic algorithm shows high performance, while in the scenario of high proportions particle swarm optimization converges to values close to those of genetic algorithm. Thus, we conclude that the algorithms used solve the proposed problem and that for a high proportion of small base station, particle swarm optimization becomes an attractive solution due to its high proximity to the results obtained via genetic algorithm and its lower computational complexity.
